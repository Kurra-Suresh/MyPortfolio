                     <p>
                            I am a Frontend Developer with 3.7 years of professional experience, currently working at LTIMindtree since June 2022. I have been involved in building and maintaining scalable, high-performance web applications using React.js and modern JavaScript in a production environment.

                     <p>
                            In my role at LTIMindtree, I focus on developing reusable React components, managing application state efficiently, and integrating RESTful APIs to deliver reliable and user-focused solutions. I work closely with designers, backend developers, and stakeholders to translate requirements into responsive and maintainable user interfaces.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                            I have hands-on experience in performance optimization, debugging production issues, and following clean code and best practices. I enjoy improving existing features, learning new frontend technologies, and contributing effectively to enterprise-level applications. I am looking to continue growing as a React / Frontend Developer, working on complex products and solving real-world problems.
